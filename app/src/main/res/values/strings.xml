    <string name="ShipwreckH1">In this seed you’ll spawn right next to a big and extraordinary ocean. Go for a swim into the far depths of the ocean and you’ll find an almost intact shipwreck surrounded by a plentiful of beautiful corals in all colors you can possibly imagine. It’s a great seed to try out if you want a quick way to explore some of the new ocean features which are coming in the Update Aquatic.</string>
    <string name="ShipwreckH2">The spawn is admittedly kind of normal (and boring), but the actual truth is that not far away from spawn there are plenty of corals and also a shipwreck with a treasure chest.</string>
